# RecurrentGaze

This is the implementation of the ["Recurrent CNN for 3D Gaze Estimation using Appearance and Shape Cues"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03064) paper, accepted for BMVC 2018. 

More detailed info will follow shortly. Trained models will be available the first week of October. Models used in the paper, divided into folds, are available on demand due to their size.
