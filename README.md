# RecurrentGaze

This is the implementation of the ["Recurrent CNN for 3D Gaze Estimation using Appearance and Shape Cues"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03064) paper, accepted for BMVC 2018. 

Trained weights using EYEDIAP dataset are available for the following models: NFEL5836, NFEL5836_2918 and NFEL5836GRU. Models used in the paper, divided into folds, are available on demand due to their size. More detailed info will follow shortly.
